Natural Language Processing in Python

Project Motivation
------------------
Speaking from personal experience, it can be difficult to dine out safely when you have a special dietary need. As someone who cannot eat gluten, I must be careful about where I eat. I was motivated to create PlatePal to make it easier for people like myself to make dining decisions.

PlatePal is designed to complement exisiting sites like Yelp by providing a sentiment score for a restaurant review, evaluating it for a relevant dietary category on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is bad and 1 is good. The scores are generated by performing sentiment analysis on relevant sentences in reviews containing keywords in the categories. Currently, PlatePal scores restaurants for the following categories: Gluten-Free, Vegan, Kosher, Allergy, and Paleo.

Project Objectives
------------------
Being able to perform the sentiment analysis involved the following

- Find a large dataset containing relevant restaurant reviews.
- Seed this information into a database.
- Build a document classifier to be able to categorize reviews.
- Build a sentiment analysis classifier to be able to score reviews.

- Calculate aggregate scores for businesses.
- Present the information in an intuitive, user-friendly format.

... easier said than done!
