Onion rings were one of my favorite unhealthy foods before I found out I am gluten intolerant, so as soon as I learned of Blue Moon's dedicated gluten-free fryer I took a trip to this location to try their GF onion rings. I ordered up a cheeseburger to go with it, and noted at the start of my order that everything should be gluten free. 

The food was ready in a jiffy, and it was pretty good. My favorite part was the Blue Moon sauce, which came on the side to avoid potential cross-contamination from a spatula (according to their website). The onion rings awesome, considering that they were gluten free, and they were slightly better than good in general. I liked everything so much, that I went back the next day to have another burger and some sweet potato fries, which were perfectly fluffy inside and crunch outside. I have missed that texture so much, after settling for sweet potato fries baked in our oven at home.

Thanks, Blue Moon, for giving us gluten-free folks a great burger option!
