Asian Box to the rescue! I had a lunch fail at Crepevine and was really thankful that Asian Box is a short walk down Castro Street. It rocks that everything on the menu is gluten free -- I really appreciated knowing that I would have a safe meal, especially after the bad experience at Crepevine that would have made me sick had I stayed.

I would suspect that pretty much everything is good here, although I went for the pork with sriracha. The meal was filling and a good value, and it was fairly tasty. I had a long bike ride back to San Jose, and the generous portion of rice was exactly what I needed to get there quickly. 

The wait was fairly short, given that I placed my order during the lunch rush. The staff were extremely courteous and made helpful suggestions. The outdoor seating is a huge plus, too.
