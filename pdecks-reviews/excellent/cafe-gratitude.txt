Years ago, I ate dinner here a few times and thought the food was OK even if my tummy was extra "talkative" afterward.

Fast forward to this summer, when I've stopped in a few times when it has been slow to get a smoothie. Both times it has taken way too long to prepare my order. It took 10 minutes today, and I was very displeased. No one apologized for the delay. I will not be back, at least not for anything requiring preparation.
