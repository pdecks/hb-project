Hooray for gluten-free pastries, breads, and ... sandwiches!! So far I've only tried a madeline and a cinnamon roll, but I am already hooked! It's close to my office downtown but just enough of a walk to keep me from going there several times a day, hah! 

The women working when I dropped by last week were very sweet and friendly. It wasn't busy at the time, so they took a moment to explain all of their offerings once I mentioned that it was my first visit to their bakery. Had I not packed my lunch that day, I would have been all over the shrimp po' boy that was the sandwich of the day.
