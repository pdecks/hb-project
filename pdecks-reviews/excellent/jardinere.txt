Jardiniere went above and beyond in providing me with a stellar dining experience even though I have a dietary restriction. As someone who cannot eat gluten, I often feel excluded when dining out, which is generally a stressful experience. Based on some of the other Yelp reviews, I felt good about making a reservation here for a special occasion meal.

From start to finish, the meal was perfection. My gluten-loving significant other and I both ordered the tasting menu, and our server assured me with confidence that they could make substitutions for a few of the items. They brought out some amuse bouche -- even GF versions for me(!); they gave me delicious GF bread (!!); and they even had tasty GF pasta that was close to the real thing. I never felt like I was missing out or that I was a burden. It was a relaxed affair, and I am so grateful to the entire staff's commitment to excellent service for all diners.
