I love coming here because the food is always delicious and the service is always top-notch. As someone who cannot eat gluten, I am always rolling the dice when I eat out, but I can relax when I dine at Blue Plate because I know that the staff -- front and back -- are educated about creating a safe dining experience for glutards like me. 

The handful of times that we have dined here in recent months, the servers have always given me great advice on which dishes could be easily converted to gluten free -- by leaving off a fried bit of something or other or by substituting a sauce. Twice one of the chefs has stepped out of the kitchen to ask for my input/approval on a specific substitution. Seriously, so awesome. Thank you, Blue Plate!
