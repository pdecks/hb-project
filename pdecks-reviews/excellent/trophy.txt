Although my company has ordered these cupcakes for all of us as special "thank yous" for our hard work, I hadn't actually tried one until today because I am gluten intolerant. Today I learned that Trophy offers some GF options (note: not safe for Celiacs because they are not prepared in a separate facility), so I stopped in to their kiosk at Pacific Place. I don't like chocolate (I know!) so I ordered the other GF cupcake available: cherries jubilee. 

This was, hands down, the best cupcake I have had in my life. It was moist and delicious with a cherry filling that oozed from the cake's center. The frosting was not overly sweet, as far as frosting goes, and the whole thing was topped with a brandied cherry. Yum! The cherry on top was also decorated with edible gold glitter, making for a very elegant presentation. I truly felt like this cupcake was something special, and it was well worth the $4. 

Part of me can't believe that this was actually a GF cupcake (it was that good). I guess time will reveal the truth. I'll update this review if I suddenly get ill, but fortunately although I am gluten sensitive, I am not as intolerant as my friends with CD.
