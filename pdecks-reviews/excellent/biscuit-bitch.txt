I loved that they had gluten-free biscuits and gravy because I have been missing soul food since finding out gluten and I don't get along. The accompanying collard greens were the perfect side to my delicious mountain of pulled pork and oozing egg that was the lunchy bitch. If I weren't leaving Seattle, I'd definitely be back!
