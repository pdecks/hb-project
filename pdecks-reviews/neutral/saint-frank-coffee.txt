So delicious. So worth every penny. This is one of my favorite lattes in SF.

Saint Frank was recommended to me by a friend who has worked at several other high-end espresso bars, and his advice was spot on. The latte I ordered was perfectly balanced in terms of flavors and creaminess. 

The service was fairly good, albeit a bit robotic. It was very busy on the Monday morning that I was in, because it was a federal holiday, but the two people working the register and the bar seemed to handle the onslaught with aplomb.
