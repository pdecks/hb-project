The latte I get once a week at Small Foods is usually the best latte I have during the week. The line is usually long, and the wait for espresso drinks is equally long -- often more than 5 minutes after ordered -- thanks to the droves of techies from nearby offices who swarm on Small Foods. 

I keep coming back because of the quality of their espresso drinks. They use a special "barista milk" from Straus, which claims that the milk blend results in a better milk consistency and balance of flavors. My experiences would support that claim! Also, the fun attitudes of the people who work the espresso bar make the wait entertaining, at least.
