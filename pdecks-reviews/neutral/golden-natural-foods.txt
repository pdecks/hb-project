Four words:  Rice milk chocolate bars.

I've been on an allergy diet for the past three weeks (no dairy, no soy, no gluten, no refined sugars), and while Rainbow Grocery is my main stop for most of the unfamiliar ingredients I need, Golden Natural Foods is a close second.  Most importantly, they sell a chocolate bar without dairy and refined sugar.  It doesn't feel quite like a "diet" anymore now that I know I have such a wonderful substitute, and it makes this difficult experience much more enjoyable.

I like their selection overall - they also sell Coconut Bliss, a wonderful non-dairy frozen dessert.  I'll never go back to regular ice cream ... at least excluding BiRite ... if I ever get to return to consuming dairy products.
