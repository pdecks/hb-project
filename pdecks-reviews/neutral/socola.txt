I am probably missing out on the best that Socola has to offer because I cannot eat gluten, sugar, or chocolate. I came here for the one legal drug that I do still consume -- coffee! The latte I had was just OK. The location is a bit out of the way for me, and with so many other good coffee places nearby, the coffee was not good enough to convince me to return.
