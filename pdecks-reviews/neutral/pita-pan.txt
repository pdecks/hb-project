I wish had read some of the reviews on here and saved myself the sorrow of a lame dinner.  I had a babaganoush sandwich and was disgusted by how it's served in a flour tortilla.  And the dudes working there forgot about my order and had me standing around for a solid 5 minutes before they realized their mistake and made me a crappy sandwich.  Blech.
