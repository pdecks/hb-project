I cannot recommend Crepevine if gluten makes you sick. I had to bail on my meal here after a series of mistakes that would have made me ill. Fortunately, the management provided me with a refund and I was able to eat safely somewhere else.

I was excited to try one of their gluten-free crepes, and I made sure to order my crepe with a side of potatoes, not fries, given that the fries are definitely cross-contaminated. It was the lunch rush, so I had to wait quite a while for my crepe, at least 15 minutes. When a server arrived with my meal, I asked if the crepe was gluten free. She said that she did not know and would check, walking off with the plate. I waited at least another 10 minutes without anyone coming by my table. When a different server finally arrived with the correct crepe, it was now accompanied by fries. I gave up and asked for a refund. I appreciate their effort, but it seems that they have a long-way to go with educating staff about safe food handling for people with allergies.
