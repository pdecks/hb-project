On my third visit here, I was disappointed to find that the one gluten-free seafood entree that I had ordered twice before and thoroughly enjoyed, the chupe de marisco, had been completely revamped. Note that the other two gluten-free entrees are vegetarian, so I pretty much had one option here. 

Previously, the seafood stew had a savory, creamy base that was really flavorful. The revised dish now comes with an overlooked egg on top and a bunch of flavorless cooked rice hidden in the bottom of the stew, both of which made this stew worse. As someone who doesn't care for rice, I was disappointed when I realized halfway through the dish that it had rice. The generous portion of seafood on top hide this at first. Also, my waiter did not serve the stew with a spoon or any utensil. I had to flag down the hostess after waiting several minutes for the dish to get cold.

The other fumble was that no one seemed to care. When the waiter took my half eaten plate and asked if everything was all right, I shared that the changes to the dish were not an improvement. No one followed up on this. 

I won't be coming back, as now there is nothing gluten-free here that is worth ordering.

Also, a caveat to other GF diners, they have a vegetarian entree that is marked as gluten free but the description says it contains soy sauce. That seems like a disaster waiting to happen.
