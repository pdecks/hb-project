I came here today on a lunch reservation with coworkers to welcome a new employee to or team. The service was timely and efficient, and my coworkers were all satisfied with the food. The menu has many choices, and I appreciated that, according to so many other Yelp reviewers, they could be accommodating of gluten-free dietary needs. The key word is "could."

I got glutened. I am ill. It was not anyone's fault per se, but nevertheless I cannot recommend their restaurants to other people who cannot have gluten.

When I placed my order, I asked whether a certain dish could be made GF and the waiter said that it could. He said, "no soy sauce or black bean sauce, right?" And I said that i assumed that was the case unless they used wheat-free soy sauce. He said, "no problem."

The problem was realizing that I needed more veggies with my meal. I hadn't ordered any of my own and the Henry's Special was mostly protein, which is normally a huge plus. I asked him if the string beans we already had on the table were safe for me to eat. He said yes. I then ate about 2 cups of green beans. I was putting a bean in my mouth when the waiter came over with a plate of green beans for our table. For me.  He thought I had asked for a new order of GF green beans and told me at that point that the green beans on the table had soy sauce on them. I was crushed but knew it was a miscommunication.

Maybe this location isn't as good as the others about making sure gluten free diners can dine safely.

Be extra careful if you do decide to risk coming here.
