I ordered a lunch special of two pupusas with beans, cream, and plantains. The food was all tasty, but I suspect they use soybean oil for prep/frying. I have a soy intolerance and I ended up with an awful headache and felt drugged the rest of the day. The service could have been better. They seemed impatient because the World Cup was on.
