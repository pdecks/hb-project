In my post-moving stupor, I stumbled out of my apartment on my first night in the neighborhood in search of food.  My standards were quite low at that point, but unfortunately it was after 10pm on a Thursday night, and Raja was one of the few places that seemed to welcome customers.  Well, welcome might be putting it too nicely.  

I should have known by the lack of customers what was in store for me that night.  And the next day.  I ordered a vegetarian dish that was mostly flavorless and it somehow came back to bite me.  I can't wait to try some of the good indian food around here -- it's just a shame that this had to be my first dinner in the 'hood.
