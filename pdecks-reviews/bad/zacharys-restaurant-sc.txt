Seeing as this is the 99th review of Zachary's, it's like you could take my review down and pass it around and there's be 98 reviews of Zachary's on the wall.

After a windy ride down the hill, my meal at Zachary's was warming both physically and socially.  Sitting at the counter, I enjoyed a surprisingly good cup of coffee -- I'm more of an espresso-type drinker when it comes to caffeine -- and a delicious artichoke frittata.  Stellar home fries.  Honestly, the dark rye toast alone would have earning a rave review from me.

The wooden floors, battered by the shuffling feet of the tired and hungry who come here in search of an eye-opening meal, lent themselves to this feeling of continuity.  Like Zachary's had always been there.  Then again, 22 years of service will do that to a business.  It's the only way to have breakfast in Santa Cruz, in my short-term-visitor's opinion.
