Like a fool without beeswax in the presence of sirens I found myself returning to Bacheeso's for it second try.  It was my fondness for the accordion player who had been mashing on his squeezebox the first time we came here that lured me back.  My quasi-Odyssean episode is the only thing I could identify as being vaguely Mediterranean about my  experience.

If you like bad service, then this is the place for you!  If pecking around a poorly-stocked buffet is your idea of a good meal, then by all means!  Yes, the hummus is delicious, but everything else reminded me of my freshman dining hall at NYU*.  At least there they weren't trying to tell me my grilled cheese sandwich soaked in lard was "healthy."  I wish this buffet had some grilled cheese ... it probably would have been less scary than their "pizza."  

*Now that I think about it, my dining hall had a lovely siren of its own:  singing Silvia -- "... the most handsome-est men and beautiful ladies on cammmmm-puuuus ..."
