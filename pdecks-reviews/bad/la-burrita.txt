There was a time in my graduate studies when I spent late nights on campus, and during that time I frequented La Burrita because I could get something relatively healthy to eat for a reasonable price at a somewhat late hour.   Thankfully, those days are over.  Studying in a windowless building for hours every night is arduous enough, but eating La Burrita and ending up with a tummy ache while trying to study is sheer torture.  

I don't like feeling ill after eating what looks like an innocent burrito, but that's exactly what happened on more than a few occasions to myself and my friends.  The shady-factor of food prep doesn't seem to be an issue unique to La Burrita, though, because I find myself feeling a bit queasy from a number of "restaurants" in the North Gate area.  

Friends don't let friends eat La Burrita.
