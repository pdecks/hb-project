I could have sworn I wrote a scathing review about this place back in August after getting seriously ill from some food from here.  A group in our department had a Friday lunch catered by Jasmine Thai and while the food was tasty, I was laid up on the couch for half the weekend feeling like I had been shot with a tranquilizer dart.  NOT that I have first hand experience with that.  I'm usually just the one shooting the darts.  If by shooting the darts you mean making paper airplanes.

I guess in that food-poisioning-induced trance I forgot to spread the word.  Some sort of MSG mind trick, I suppose.

Many moons having passed since that incident, I decided to give their food another try yesterday.  It wasn't exactly worth the money for the hot lunch tray items, unless you think a giant pile of mostly rice is worth $6.  And, surprise surprise, I ended up with a terrible headache and felt like not-a-million-bucks the rest of the day.  Worst restaurant in the North Gate area by far.  Even La Burrita doesn't make me feel ill EVERY time I eat there.  As Meatloaf said, "two out of three ain't bad."
