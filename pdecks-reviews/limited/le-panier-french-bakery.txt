As someone who is gluten intolerant, I can only enjoy the aromas of the many delicious looking baked goods here. However, what really draws me to this bakery on a regular basis are their delightful macarons, which, in case you didn't know, are gluten free. Theirs are delicious little clouds ... although at $2 they are quite an expensive cookie. Having once tried to make macarons at home, I appreciate just how finicky a cookie they can be. The ginger is my favorite!
