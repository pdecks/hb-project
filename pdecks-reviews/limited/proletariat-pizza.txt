We ate here last night with a huge group, and the food and the service were excellent! I loved the ham and egg pizza, and the mixed green salad was pretty good, too. My only wish would have been to have tried the gluten-free dough -- they ran out last night before we got there, so I had to make due with scraping the cheese and toppings off the crust. (I am fortunate that I have that option, unlike people who are more than just gluten sensitive.)

We would definitely make the trek from Fremont again, except I'll probably call ahead to make sure that they have the GF dough. The pizza looked like real NY-style pies, and as someone who grew up around NYC, I can't wait to try the complete package.
