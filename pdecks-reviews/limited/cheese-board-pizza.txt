I was a regular here until I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance. My office recently had a picnic, and the people organizing the food told me about Cheese Board's recent addition of gluten-free crust to their menu. They got me a pizza, but I am fairly certain that it was cross-contaminated enough to make me ill. I have been having a rough week of tummy troubles since I ate the pizza more than 5 days ago. I really miss their brioches, though. Those were my favorites back when I was destroying my intestines with their delicious breads.
