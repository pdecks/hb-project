Over the past year I noticed how the crowd at Albatross -- Berkeley's oldest pub -- rapidly went from middle-aged blue-collar watering hole, to grad student playground.  With scores of board games you can "rent" (this is used loosely, because you only need to put down an ID), "free" popcorn (for a 25-cent bowl rental charge), dart stalls, a pool table, a rec-room feel, a  full bar, and endless list of tasty brews it's easy to have a good time here.  Sometimes snagging a table can be difficult, so you might need to arrive early (before 10pm) if you have a larger group.  Try the Berliner and Raspberry Chassis.  It rocks.  Albatross also has the distinct honor of having cured me of my fear of vodka, thanks to the Lemon Drop I had one night during my gluten-free stint.  I feel so liberated!
