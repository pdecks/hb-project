Last month, my bf and I came here on dinner date to celebrate my birthday. I cannot eat gluten, and I appreciated that they had a selection of GF dishes. My only qualm was that the GF menu they have listed online is outdated. Not all of the items on the GF menu are available all the time, it seems. Only those items currently on the full menu are available. It wasn't a big deal, but I did have my heart set on something that wasn't available.

We sat outside and enjoyed the warm March evening. (Is it always that warm? I live in SF, so it was warm to me!) Reservations, although I had made one, weren't necessary at the height of dinner on a weeknight. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Service was efficient and prompt, and the timing of our starters and entrees was appropriate. 

To start, we had the ginger pork ribs and the butter lettuce leaf salad, both of which were smaller portions than we had expected, especially the salad. The pork ribs were OK, but not great. 

For dinner, I had the roasted chicken -- after the waitress checked with the kitchen that it did not contain gluten. She assured me that it was only cooked in its own juices, without any flour or the usual suspects added for flavor. It came with an assortment of well-seasoned, perfectly cooked vegetables, my favorite of which was the kabocha, which had been roasted to a nice crispy finish. My bf had the seared pork chop with roasted apple sauce, which I was also able to taste, as it also appears on the GF menu. It was melt-in-your-mouth heavenly, although the apple sauce was just a bit too sweet for my tastes.

I felt OK the next day, so I give this place a tentative two thumbs up for gluten-free dining.
