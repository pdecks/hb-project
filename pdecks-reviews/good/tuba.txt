Tuba was a pleasant surprise. We made a reservation for 2 for a Friday night. We had never been here before, and I was excited to check it out because their menu reflected some consideration of gluten-free guests. The service we received was warm and friendly, and the food was delicious! We will certainly be coming back soon.
