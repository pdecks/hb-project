Recently, I went here on a Sunday before a Giants game to pick up a salad to bring into the ballpark. I have been to Tender Green's other location in downtown, so I was already familiar with their menu. The quality of the salad was excellent, but service was a little slow, especially considering that there were not too many people being helped. I suppose there could have been people calling in orders to go. There was a sign on the counter saying that orders could be placed online, but the website states that this location is not currently taking online order. Either way, it is a great option for healthy pre-game food.
