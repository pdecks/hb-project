I love the espresso here, but I must be the only person who does not like the Snowy Plover. Ah well. I tried it on a hot day last month, and I found it to be too cloying. I'll just be sticking to their reliably excellent cappuccinos and lattes from here on out. On a gluten-free note, apparently their corn muffins ARE gluten-free, as I learned from my friend with Celiac who runs her own GF bread business. Woot! Swing by after the mid-morning rush because long lines are for suckers.
