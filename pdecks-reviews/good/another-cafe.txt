The coffee is delicious here, although the service could maybe be a bit friendlier. I'll put up with it because the espresso is worth is. They also sell gluten-free cookies -- I haven't tried them but I appreciate their offering them! It looks like a nice place to get some work done, especially because of the colorful paintings lining the upper balcony seating.
