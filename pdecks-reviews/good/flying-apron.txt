I wish I liked the pastries from here more, but, like others, I find that their flours rely too much on garbanzo and that most of the sweets are overly sweet. I love the uniqueness of the cardamom cupcake with chai frosting, but it is definitely too sweet for me to eat more than a few times a year. I recently tried one of their lemon whoopie pie creations. It was really sticky ... so it was sort of awkward to eat. And it was also about 2x as sweet as I would have liked.
