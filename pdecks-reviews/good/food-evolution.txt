On a recent family visit to the region, friends and I visited this location in search of delicious food that would be safe for someone with a gluten allergy -- me. I asked for a lettuce-wrapped Bison cheeseburger, and they were more than happy to oblige. They also offer gluten-free buns. I also had a side of the fig and balsamic roasted veggies after the person taking orders confirmed that the marinade did not include soy sauce or other sources of gluten. I felt good the day after, so I would definitely give this place more of my business on my next trip. I appreciate that they offer several gluten-free options, such as bowls with a rice, saut√©ed spinach or mixed greens base.
