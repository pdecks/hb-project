So delicious, but I went in with no expectations.  I had the A15 arepa -- stuffed with chorizo, jalapenos and a spicy white cheese -- and split some chips/guac and tostones with my lady friend.  We were thoroughly satisfied when we rolled out, but only after we had the flan.

Hands down, the best flan I've ever had.  The caramelized sauce on the top had a subtle molasses flavor, and the flan's texture wasn't slippery but a little on the fluffy side.  Personally, I don't like slick desserts too much, jell-o included.

They'll take their time on getting you the check and change, but it's in a respectful have-your-conversation-and-chill-out sort of way, not a we're-ignoring-you sort of way.
