I have been here for lunch several times, as I work nearby and I know I can get a tasty gluten-free meal here. I really appreciate that they took the extra step of drawing up a gluten-free menu, because there is nothing like finding out you can only eat one or two dishes from a menu of fifty items. With or without reservations, we have been seated promptly and always received good service. The one time I dined here with a group of about 12 people, there was a bit of a delay with the food -- one person's meal arrived a good 10 minutes after the second-to-last dish to arrive. I know the restaurant from their New York location near Lincoln Center, so my expectations were realistic -- tasty food at slightly expensive prices. I used to get the pollo pibil, which I had always found to be generous, but apparently the portions have changed.
