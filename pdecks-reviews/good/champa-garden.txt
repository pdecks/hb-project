The couple times that we have eaten here, it has always been busy and the food has been worth the wait. I learned tonight that they can make dishes using gluten-free soy sauce and that they seem to be knowledgable in accommodating gluten-free requests. I had been sticking to safe options -- the larp salad and tom kha soup -- but I will definitely venture into soy sauce territory on our next visit. Yum!
