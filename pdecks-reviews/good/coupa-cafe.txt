I stopped in to Coupa today for a cappuccino, but I will definitely be back for some food the next time I am in Palo Alto. My cappuccino was perfect -- the milk had a velvety texture and the espresso was rich with a well-rounded body and slight bitterness that complemented the natural sweetness of the milk. My friend had the cachapa and a chai, both of which she said were exceedingly good. I am excited to try some of the arepas and other gluten-free dishes soon!
